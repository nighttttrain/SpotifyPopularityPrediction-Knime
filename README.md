The data transformation, aggregation, cleaning and preparation process was applied before the experiments. The experimental process included feature selection, hyperparameter tuning and evaluating the performance of the training and validation sets.

Specifically, the test result for the polynomial regression of R-squared was 0.254, and the RMSE is 12.683. On the other hand, the RMSE for RF regression model was 12.834, and the R-squared is 0.236.
